<p>I love travelling, playing games, and sometimes reading books. I also watch Web series in my free time. I prefer 
  english movies and music as it helps in improving my English.  </p>

<p>Academically, I have scored SGPI - 8.95 in the first sem, and SGPI - 9.52 in my second sem. So, my Academic chart is 
  increasing :) I'm well-versed in few coding languages(C,Java,HTML). I have joined a Web development course in order learn more about it.
  In my college campus, there's also many events and a game zone which includes games like Pool(Snooker),Table Tennis, Foosball,
  Air Hockey, Carrom, Chess etc. There's also PS5. The game I enjoy playing the most would be Foosball. Its a great team game.
